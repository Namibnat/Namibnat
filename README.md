### Hi, I'm Vernon

I've been a hobby programmer since my early childhood.  I started coding with BASIC back in the 80s, but thus far my career has always been in tourism.  My work has focused on leading guiding teams and training guides in Namibia.  I recently resigned from 
[AndBeyond Sossusvlei Desert Lodge][sossus-desert-lodge], Namibia's premier lodge.  I was leading their guide teams until I left.

The Covid pandemic had a massive impact on tourism in Namibia.  When our lodge shut down, I decided to start to work full time on skills that were of interest to me.  To a large extend this meant code.

After the initial lockdown, I did go and work at the lodge again, but resigned later in 2020.  From then on, I have been working full time on developing these interests.

I moved to the UK in mid-October.  I'm British, even though I lived most of my life in Africa, so it was an easy move.

My current plan is to get a job as a developer or data analyst, but then to keep on learning, hopefully to the point that I can get a degree some time in my early 50s.  The dream is to work all the way to a doctrate in some way, relating to math, the environment and code.  Hopefully before I'm 60.  Lets see.


### What I do:

I enjoy working with  [Python][python].  I've got a good grasp of [Django][django].  The area I'm most interested in right now is more the data analytics side, and I've got some basic Python Data Science understanding.

I'm a Linux enthusiast, currently running [Manjaro][manjaro].  I've also used [Ubuntu][ubuntu] and [Arch Linux][arch] often.  I've installing many distros to play around with them, and at one stage I did a whole [Linux From Scratch][LFS] build.

I love teaching, and I have taught beginner Python to various people over the years, and I'd love to do more of that.

I also enjoy math and a long term goal is to improve my math skills and learn Python Data Science and related skills.

I was a founding board member of the [Python Namibia Society][pynam].

I am not a Python purest, and enjoy tinkering with other languages.  I was very interested in C some time back, and always think I might get back into it at some point.

### What is my long term dream?


Between 1995 and 1997 I studied towards a diploma in nature conservation.  I never finished.  I still had two subjects that I needed to pass when I left.  But one experience toward the end of my time there left a big impression on me.

I went to college rather unsure of what I was hoping to do.  And really didn‚Äôt make the most of it until I‚Äôd done a couple years.  Then, in 1997 I did an internship at the FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology[http://www.fitzpatrick.uct.ac.za/].  This was my first proper exposure to natural sciences, and suddenly a deep interest was born.

The trouble was, I was out of money.  So, in 1998, I took on a job as a tour guide in Namibia, fully believing that I would eventually work my way back to a dedicated degree program in natural sciences.  But, work became interesting, and other things happened.  Most notably, I had some babies.

Somehow over 20 years have slipped by, and the dream has never disappeared.  I remained interested in science, and with my work in tourism, I managed to have frequent, and interesting, contact with the scientific community in Namibia.  But work was incredibly busy and trying just to keep up was tough.  I often worked long hours.  But I did keep learning.

Aside from the natural sciences, during this time I also started becoming very serious about coding.  Python became my language of choice, and I became interested in Linux.

In 2020, the Coronavirus epidemic was a sudden upset in how everything was going, and I found myself with time on my hands.  So, when I wasn‚Äôt working, I started throwing myself into studying, partly nature and partly programming.  It didn‚Äôt take long before I thought maybe I could make a big career change, to a job where I didn‚Äôt work nights and weekends, and perhaps, I could use programming as an avenue back to studying science.  So, towards the end of 2020 I left my job in Namibia and moved to the UK to see if I could pursue this dream.

So, this post is my own ramblings about what it would take to actually take this all the way.  I‚Äôm in my late 40s, so if I was to go all the way and do a doctorate, while having to work my way through it, I would probably have to dedicate the reminder of my normal working life to it.  Hopefully I‚Äôm healthy enough that I don‚Äôt have to stop by 65, so that I can keep making contributions towards science if I was to meet my study goals.

So, if I was to achieve that, how might that look?  What would I need to do, what would I need to learn?

Well, firstly, what would be the ideal outcome?  I think a doctorate in climate modeling would be roughly what I‚Äôm aiming for.

My plan is to start with a degree program from the Open University.  Bsc (honours) mathematics and physics.  I hope to start with the course late 2021, and with a rough six years ahead of me, this would mean a BSc by 2027, by which time I‚Äôll be nearing my mid 50s.

Before I get there, I‚Äôm studying a few relevant fields that I hope will help me both in getting my course work done, and to give me an advantage in taking this in the direction that i‚Äôd like to.



This  is what I‚Äôm studying now:

| Subject | Resource |
| ----: | -----: |
| SQL   | currently I'm doing the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/  |
| Stats | currently reading "The Art of Statistics" (David Spiegelhalter) book. |
| Machine Learning      | currently working through "Deep Learning for coders with fastai and pytorch" book. |
| Probability           | currently reading "Probability For The Enthusiastic Beginners" (David Morin) Book. |
| Linear Algebra        | "Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra"                                           |
| Precalculus           | "https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus"                                     |
| Google Data Analytics | "https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics"         |




If I look over entry requirements for a PhD in climate science, typically the following would be required, and so these are all things that I‚Äôd work towards.

 - Linux with research experience running numerical physics-based models
 - Python (Pandas, Numpy, Jupyter Notebooks)
 - Machine Learning
 - R
 - C
 - Fortran
 - Handling Large Datasets
 - Cluster based computing
 - Cloud computing and with geophysical and ideally ocean/atmosphere/climate data
 - Distinction in a master‚Äôs degree (2.1 minimum), Physics, Mathematics, Meteorology/Climate science.
 - Statistics

In terms of work, I‚Äôm hoping to find a job that can help me fund my studies, and give me evenings and weekends free to study.  And, ideally, if I can use any of the tech I‚Äôm learning, that would be a bonus.

With this dream, should I fail to achieve it, it will still be worth following for me.  I love studying this stuff, and knowing a little more of how the world works is a good thing, even if it simply makes me a better citizen of the world.

### Are you hiring?

I'm looking for work, and ideally I'd love to work as a **data analyst** or some related role.  I have some basic website skills as well.  In the long run, if the job involves conservation or even green tech, that would be a dream.  I did about 90% of the [Udemy Web Development Bootcamp][udemy-web-dev] at the start of the year.

Through my years in the tourism industry I've learned **leadership** and simple hard work.  I've managed small teams and worked with high-end clientele.
