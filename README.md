### Hi, I'm Vernon

üå± I'm a full-stack developer with a deep passion for Python, Django, and React. I've built scalable web applications and have a diverse skill set that includes:

Languages: Python, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS
Frameworks: Django, Flask
Tools: Git, GitHub, Docker, Docker-compose

üåå Beyond coding, I'm deeply passionate about nature conservation, cycling, birding, astronomy, and languages. Currently, I'm immersing myself in learning Spanish, following the [Refold][refold] methodology with my wonderful teacher [Eliana][eliana] from [Italki][italki].

üåµ My journey into tech is a bit unconventional. I've been a hobby programmer since the 80s, starting with BASIC. However, until 2020, my career was rooted in tourism, leading guiding teams and training guides in Namibia, at [AndBeyond Sossusvlei Desert Lodge][sossus-desert-lodge]. The pivot to tech was driven by my innate curiosity and the global shifts brought about by the pandemic.

üá¨üáß After moving to the UK in 2020, I began my professional tech journey with [Octophindigital][octophin], where the company's focus on nature conservation resonated with my personal values.

I'm always open to collaborating on projects, especially those aligned with tech-for-good. Let's connect!

### Stuff I'm into:

üîß Technical Interests:

Languages & Frameworks: Proficient in [Python][python], [Django][django], [Flask][flask], and [React][react]. Curious about C and Kotlin.
Operating Systems: A Linux enthusiast with experience in [Ubuntu][ubuntu], [Arch Linux][arch], and [Linux From Scratch][LFS]. Also familiar with macOS.
Community Involvement: Founding board member of the [Python Namibia Society][pynam]. Passionate about teaching Python to beginners.
üåç Non-Coding Interests:

Ecology: Studied nature conservation with a special interest in desert ecology.
Birding: Active in bird counts, birding tours, and general birdwatching.
Fitness & Health: Enjoys walking, cycling, and maintaining a healthy diet.
Current Affairs: Keen on understanding global events and their backgrounds. Actively involved in making positive changes.
Personal Growth: Passionate about teaching, coaching, leading, and public speaking.

### My Github repositories:

When I started to push code to Github, my intension was never to find work as a software developer. Much of what I pushed up were projects I worked on while I was learning one or other skill. Sometimes it
was to try to provide a bit of code to work with together with kids who I was tutoring. Often, as a tour guide, I would have breaks, and then be back on the road for weeks or months, during which time
I put all my projects on hold. But I found these things fun. I love going back and looking at how I did things in the past.

### Hire me:

I've loved getting my foot in the door as a software developer. In the early part of 2020, with the outbreak of Covid, I found myself with time on my hands, after what had been the most incredibly
busy few years of my life. So I jumped into coding again.

When I arrived in the UK, I carried on with my training, and then started to look for work as lock-downs eased at the start of 2021.

What I would bring to a team:

- I have a good grasp of Python and I'm very comfortable in Linux environments. My strongest subjects at school were always maths, and I think this mathematical mindset helps me in the code I write.
- I love things being organized. I love writing clean, tested code, and want to get better at it.
- I love learning. I'll gladly learn your tech-stack. I'm happy to get feedback and learn from it.
- I love people. I'm quiet, but I'm very much a people-person.
- I'm dedicated and very hard working. Easy to say, of course.
- If the job fits me well, I'm keen to stay with a team and help it grow.

This is what I'd ideally like as work:

- Location: Either in Birmingham, a nearby commute or remote.
- Programming language: I've love to work with Python, but I love learning, and I'm happy to jump into anything else.
- Values: I take my own values very seriously, and I would only want to work for a company where things like diversity, inclusion... general liberal values, are important.
- "Tech for good": I want my work to matter. Conservation has been a big priority in my life, and still is. But I'm open to any position where what I do helps make the world a better place.
- A chance to lead down the line. I have long worked in leadership in some way or another, and I'd love to work in a team big enough that down the line I can find myself in some form of leadership.
- Benefits and salary: I'd love to earn somewhere around 40K right now, more would be better, of course. I'm not that concerned about other benefits, but if the team I work with are happy, I'm happy, so the main value of other benefits that I see are ones that promote a team that loves to be there. Where people are proud of where they work and happy to be there.
