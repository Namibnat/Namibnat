### Hi, I'm Vernon, an aspiring developer

I've been a hobby programmer since my early childhood.  I started coding with BASIC back in the 80s, but thus far my career has always been in tourism.  My work has focused on leading guiding teams and training guides in Namibia.  I recently resigned from 
[AndBeyond Sossusvlei Desert Lodge][sossus-desert-lodge], Namibia's premier lodge.  I had been leading their guide teams.

I'm working on my coding skills to the level where I can enter the industry as a software developer.  The reason I'm doing it now is due to Covid which shut down the tourism industry for a while in Namibia.  I've wanted to make this transition for a long time, but my job has been all-consuming in recent years.  So, the lock down was a gift to finally get down to learn a lot more.

I moved to the UK in mid-October.  I'm British, even though I lived most of my life in Africa, so it was an easy move.  My plan is to find work as a developer, ideally remote, but I'd like to be based in the West Midlands.  If you're after someone like me, please get [in touch][website].


### What I do:

I enjoy working with [Python][python] and I'm working on building up my skills in [Django][django] and related technologies with the hope of working as a back-end or full-stack developer in the UK, within the next couple months.  I've built a number of websites using Django over the years, though the only one that's still online is my own website: [vernon-swanepoel.me][website]

I'm a long time Linux enthusiast, currently running [Manjaro][manjaro], though I've also used [Ubuntu][ubuntu] and [Arch Linux][arch], as well as installing many distros just to play around with them, and at one stage I did a whole [Linux From Scratch][LFS] build.

I love teaching, and I have taught beginner Python to various people over the years, and I'd love to do more of that going forward.

I also enjoy math and a long term goal is to improve my math skills and learn Python Data Science and related skills, but I've put that on hold for a while until I have a deep skill set to get me started in working with Python/Django on the web first.  

I've had some involvement in developing Python in Namibia, and I'm still currently on the board of [Python Namibia][pynam], though my contributions have been way less than I would have hoped, mainly because my work has been rather intense in the last few years.


### What I'm working on:

- I'm working on my own website, [vernon-swanepoel.me][website].
- I recently completed a small JavaScript [Date Picker][Date Picker].
- I'm building demo app that [tracks recruits][Recruit App] across several teams with a Django Backend.
- I have a more long term project using Django and React together as a personal Productivity app, [Your Routines and Projects][YRAP].
- I have a more 'fun' project that I work on from time to time where I'm trying to build a C compiler [Spheniscidaecc][spheniscidaecc].  This project isn't really a demo project, but rather more of a fun side project of my own.  Why the name?  Well, I'm an avid nature enthusiast, and a big part of that is birding.  And I think some of the strangest birds are [Penguins][Penguin].  Additionally, the Linux mascot is a penguin.  Lastly, my long term goal is to bring together my love of coding and my concern for the natural world, and Penguins nicely symoblize the issues of global warming.

### What I'm learning:

I'm a life-long learner, and so it's thrilling to take time right now to simply focus 100% on learning the following:

- While I have some time my main focus right now is to brush up on my JavaScript and web tech.

### Are you hiring?

If you happen to be in the West Midlands area, and you're looking for a Django developer, **I might be of value to your organization if** you're looking for the following: A developer who has skills in **Python**, **Django**, **Django Rest Framework**, **some front-end capability**, including HTML5, CSS3, and **React** (soon, I'm still learning basic React), and someone who has a deep love of both **teaching** and **learning**.  Additionally, through my years in the tourism industry I've learned **leadership** through leading lead small teams, I'm very comfortable with hard work and have **good interpersonal skills** from guiding high end clients for two decades.

What I'm looking for:  A Python/Django job.  A chance to enter a team that's working on interesting things, where growth is valued and supported.  Ideally not remote, because, though quiet, I'm VERY MUCH a people person, though I know that with Covid at the moment remote is very common.
