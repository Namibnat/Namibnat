### Hi, I'm Vernon, an aspiring Python/Django developer

I've been a hobby programmer since my early childhood, coding with BASIC way back in the 80s, but thus far my career has always been in tourism, with a big focus on leading guiding teams and training guides in Namibia.  I recently resigned from [AndBeyond Sossusvlei Desert Lodge][sossus-desert-lodge], perhaps Namibias top lodge, where I have been working with the guiding team.

Right now I'm working full time on develooping my coding skills to the level where I can enter the industry as a software developer.  The reason I'm doing it now is due to Covid which shut down the tourism industry for a while in Namibia.  I've been wanting to make this transition for a long time, but my job has been all-consuming, working long hours with few breaks.  So, the lockdown was a gift to finally get down to learn deeply.

I'm planning to move to the UK (I'm British, at least by passport), where I'll stay with family until I find work.  My plan currently is to move around mid-October this year (2020), and hope to find work in the West Midlands area.


### What I do:

I enjoy working with [Python][python] and I'm working on building up my skills in [Django][django] and related techonologies with the hope of working as a back-end or full-stack developer in the UK, within the next couple months.  I've built a number of websites using Django over the years, though the only one that's still online is my own website: [sandcurves.com][website]

I'm a long time Linux enthusiast, currently running [Ubuntu][ubuntu], but I've spent a lot of time using [Arch Linux][arch], as well as installing many distros just to play around with them, and at one stage I did a whole [Linux From Scratch][LFS] build.

I love teaching, and I have taught beginner Python to various people over the years, and I'd love to do more of that going forward.

I also enjoy math and so a long term goal is to improve my math skills and learn Python Data Science and related skills, but I've put that on hold for a while until I have a deep skillset to get me started in working with Python/Django on the web first.  


### What I'm working on:

- I'm working on my own website, [sandcuves.com][website], where the main thing I'm doing now is adding a blog, the code of which you can find [here][simple-blog-code].
- I'm building a demo [Tour Company Management App][tcma-code], which I'm building with Django Rest Framework and React as I learn them.


### What I'm learning:

I'm a life-long learner, and so it's thrilling to take time right now to simply focus 100% on learning the following:

- [React][react] with [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)][udemy-react].
- [Django Rest Framework][django-rest-framework] with [The Complete Guide to Django REST Framework and Vue JS][udemy-drf].
- Web Development brush-up with [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp][udemy-web-dev].
- Algorithms, mainly through [algoexpert.io][algoexpert], which I'm finding really fun.

### Are you hiring?

I might be of value to your organization if you're looking for the following: A developer who has skills in Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, some front-end capability, including HTML5, CSS3, and React (soon, I'm still learning basic React), and someone who has a deep love of both teaching and learning.  Additionally, through my years in the tourism industry I've learned to lead small teams, I'm very comfortable with hard work and have good interpersonal skills from guiding high end clients for two decades.
