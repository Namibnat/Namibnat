### Hi, I'm Vernon

üå± I'm a full-stack developer with a deep passion for Python, Django, and React. I've built scalable web applications and have a diverse skill set that includes:

Languages: Python, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS
Frameworks: Django, Flask
Tools: Git, GitHub, Docker, Docker-compose

üåå Beyond coding, I'm deeply passionate about nature conservation, cycling, birding, astronomy, and languages. Currently, I'm immersing myself in learning Spanish, following the [Refold][refold] methodology with my wonderful teacher [Eliana][eliana] from [Italki][italki].

üåµ My journey into tech is a bit unconventional. I've been a hobby programmer since the 80s, starting with BASIC. However, until 2020, my career was rooted in tourism, leading guiding teams and training guides in Namibia, most recently at [AndBeyond Sossusvlei Desert Lodge][sossus-desert-lodge]. The pivot to tech was driven by my innate curiosity and the global shifts brought about by the pandemic.

üá¨üáß After moving to the UK in 2020, I began my professional tech journey with [Octophindigital][octophin], where the company's focus on nature conservation resonated with my personal values. After a year there,
I was hired on for a three month stint at [Filespin][filespin]. For the past year I've been honing my tech skills at [InTouch Games][intouch] where I'm still working. Although my work at InTouch has
been a wonderful opportunity to learn to program very well in Python, I'm looking forward to moving onto a role that better aligns with my values.

I'm always open to collaborating on projects, especially those aligned with tech-for-good. Let's connect!

### Stuff I'm into:

üîß Technical Interests:

Languages & Frameworks: Proficient in [Python][python], [Django][django], [Flask][flask], and [React][react]. Curious about C and Kotlin.
Operating Systems: A Linux enthusiast with experience in [Ubuntu][ubuntu], [Arch Linux][arch], and [Linux From Scratch][LFS]. Also familiar with macOS.
Community Involvement: Founding board member of the [Python Namibia Society][pynam]. Passionate about teaching Python to beginners.
üåç Non-Coding Interests:

Ecology: Studied nature conservation with a special interest in desert ecology.
Birding: Active in bird counts, birding tours, and general birdwatching.
Fitness & Health: Enjoys walking, cycling, and maintaining a healthy diet.
Current Affairs: Keen on understanding global events and their backgrounds. Actively involved in making positive changes.
Personal Growth: Passionate about teaching, coaching, leading, and public speaking.

### My Github repositories:

My journey on GitHub began not as a showcase for potential employers but as a testament to my passion for coding and learning. Each repository tells a story:

Some repositories were born out of my curiosity and the joy of learning a new skill.
Others served as collaborative platforms when tutoring young enthusiasts.
There were times when my role as a tour guide took precedence, leading to breaks in coding. Yet, each hiatus was followed by a renewed zeal to code, resulting in diverse projects.
A particular repository that holds a special place in my heart is a sudoku solver I crafted during my son's hospital stay. While the code might not be polished, the memories and emotions attached to it are invaluable.

To Recruiters and Potential Employers: While I cherish every repository as a milestone in my coding journey, I recommend focusing on my most recent projects for a professional evaluation. These represent my current skills and standards. The older ones? They're a testament to my passion, perseverance, and the joy I find in coding.

### üåü Hire me:

I'm a full-stack developer with a rich tapestry of experiences that range from the deserts of Namibia to the digital landscapes of Python, Django, and React. My coding journey is fueled by passion, curiosity, and a commitment to continuous learning. While my GitHub repositories showcase my evolution as a developer, my recent projects reflect my current expertise and dedication to crafting efficient, scalable solutions.

Beyond coding, my background in nature conservation, guiding, and leadership has instilled in me a unique perspective, strong problem-solving skills, and an ability to connect with diverse teams and clients. I'm not just looking for a job; I'm seeking a role where I can merge my love for technology with my commitment to making a positive impact.

If you're in search of a developer who brings a blend of technical prowess, a passion for nature, and a history of leadership and training, let's chat! Whether it's building tech-for-good solutions or innovating in the digital space, I'm ready for the next adventure.
