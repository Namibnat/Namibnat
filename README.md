### Hi, I'm Vernon

üå± I'm a full-stack developer with a fervor for Python, Django, and React. My journey in tech is enriched by my diverse experiences, from building scalable web applications to mentoring budding developers and guiding teams in the vast Namibian desert.

Languages & Tools: Python, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS, Django, Flask, Git, GitHub, Docker, Docker-compose.

üìö My passion for mentorship and education runs deep. From assisting in building schools in northern Kenya during my youth to teaching Python to kids and professionals alike, I've always been drawn to sharing knowledge. I've had the privilege of mentoring over 100 individuals, and the joy of seeing them grow is unparalleled.

üåå Beyond the code, I'm deeply invested in nature conservation, cycling, birding, astronomy, and languages. Currently, I'm diving into Spanish, guided by the [Refold][refold] methodology and my dedicated teacher [Eliana][eliana] from [Italki][italki].

üåµ My transition to tech, though unconventional, is a testament to my adaptability and drive. Starting as a hobby programmer with BASIC in the 80s, I later led guiding teams and trained guides in Namibia, particularly at [AndBeyond Sossusvlei Desert Lodge][sossus-desert-lodge]. The pandemic prompted a pivot, and I embraced the tech world with open arms.

üá¨üáß Post relocating to the UK in 2020, I embarked on my professional tech journey with [Octophindigital][octophin], followed by roles at [Filespin][filespin] and [InTouch Games][intouch]. While I've honed my skills at these places, I'm eager to align my career with my core values.

If you're passionate about tech-for-good or looking for a mentor in the tech space, I'd love to connect and collaborate!

### Stuff I'm into:

üîß Technical Interests:

Languages & Frameworks: Proficient in [Python][python], [Django][django], [Flask][flask], and [React][react]. Curious about C and Kotlin.
Operating Systems: A Linux enthusiast with experience in [Ubuntu][ubuntu], [Arch Linux][arch], and [Linux From Scratch][LFS]. Also familiar with macOS.
Community Involvement: Founding board member of the [Python Namibia Society][pynam]. Passionate about teaching Python to beginners.
üåç Non-Coding Interests:

Ecology: Studied nature conservation with a special interest in desert ecology.
Birding: Active in bird counts, birding tours, and general birdwatching.
Fitness & Health: Enjoys walking, cycling, and maintaining a healthy diet.
Current Affairs: Keen on understanding global events and their backgrounds. Actively involved in making positive changes.
Personal Growth: Passionate about teaching, coaching, leading, and public speaking.

### My Github repositories:

My journey on GitHub began not as a showcase for potential employers but as a testament to my passion for coding and learning. Each repository tells a story:

Some repositories were born out of my curiosity and the joy of learning a new skill.
Others served as collaborative platforms when tutoring young enthusiasts.
There were times when my role as a tour guide took precedence, leading to breaks in coding. Yet, each hiatus was followed by a renewed zeal to code, resulting in diverse projects.
A particular repository that holds a special place in my heart is a sudoku solver I crafted during my son's hospital stay. While the code might not be polished, the memories and emotions attached to it are invaluable.

To Recruiters and Potential Employers: While I cherish every repository as a milestone in my coding journey, I recommend focusing on my most recent projects for a professional evaluation. These represent my current skills and standards. The older ones? They're a testament to my passion, perseverance, and the joy I find in coding.

### üåü Hire me:

I'm a full-stack developer with a rich tapestry of experiences that range from the deserts of Namibia to the digital landscapes of Python, Django, and React. My coding journey is fueled by passion, curiosity, and a commitment to continuous learning. While my GitHub repositories showcase my evolution as a developer, my recent projects reflect my current expertise and dedication to crafting efficient, scalable solutions.

Beyond coding, my background in nature conservation, guiding, and leadership has instilled in me a unique perspective, strong problem-solving skills, and an ability to connect with diverse teams and clients. I'm not just looking for a job; I'm seeking a role where I can merge my love for technology with my commitment to making a positive impact.

If you're in search of a developer who brings a blend of technical prowess, a passion for nature, and a history of leadership and training, let's chat! Whether it's building tech-for-good solutions or innovating in the digital space, I'm ready for the next adventure.
