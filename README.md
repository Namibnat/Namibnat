### Hi, I'm Vernon


I'm a dedicated software developer.  I love working in Python, but I have a range of other skills.  My Python skills include Django, Flask, and working with APIs.  These skills include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I'm comfortable working with Git and Github, in teams and alone.  I know docker and docker-compose.  In my career, I have often been in leadership and training roles.  I especially enjoy chances to conduct training.  I'm an autodidact.

I was a hobby programmer since my early childhood.  I started coding with BASIC back in the 80s, but up until
2020, my career has been in tourism.  My work focused on leading guiding teams and training guides in Namibia.  
In the middle of 2020, I resigned from [AndBeyond Sossusvlei Desert Lodge][sossus-desert-lodge], Namibia's premier lodge.  I was leading their guide teams until I left.

The Covid pandemic had a massive impact on tourism in Namibia.  When our lodge shut down, I decided to start to work full time on skills that were of interest to me.  To a large extend this meant code.

I moved to the UK in mid-October 2020.  I'm British, even though I lived most of my life in Africa, so it was an easy move.

After spending time studying, I started work as a developer in April 2021 with [Octophindigital][octophin] as a
developer.  I've mostly worked in Python, though I've also had to learn some PHP.  The company has a strong focus on
nature conservation, which has made them a wonderful fit for me.

General interests beyond coding include cycling, birding, astronomy, languages, and science as a whole.  I'm deeply passionate about
nature conservation.  I'm learning Spanish at the moment, very slowly, with some wonderful online teachers at [Italki][italki].  My current teachers are [Yael][yael] and [Cynthia][cynthia], both of whom I highly recommend.


### Stuff I'm into:

I enjoy working with  [Python][python].  I've got a good grasp of [Django][django] and [Flask][flask].

I'm a Linux enthusiast.  I've also used [Ubuntu][ubuntu] and [Arch Linux][arch] often.  I've installing many distros to play around with them, and at one stage I did a whole [Linux From Scratch][LFS] build.
I also use a Mac for work.

I love teaching, and I have taught beginner Python to various people over the years, and I'd love to do more of that.

I was a founding board member of the [Python Namibia Society][pynam].  I'm still currently on the board.

Although I love working in Python, and enjoy tinkering with other languages.  I was very interested in C some time back, and always think I might get back into it at some point.  Kotlin is another language that looks interesting, and I've started to learn the very basics.

Non-coding interests:

- Ecology: I studied nature conservation, and I've always been interested in nature.  I have always enjoyed learning some of the more scientific aspects of ecology.  I'm certainly best at desert ecology, and I've got a good grasp as to how deserts work.
- Birds and birding: I've not only been a 'ticker', but I've learned a great deal about birds, and I've participated in bird counts and other related activities.  I have lead some birding tours, though I wouldn't consider myself an especially good birder.  I keen enthusiast.
- Fitness and health.  I like walking and cycling, and working out generally.  I eat a very disciplined, healthy diet (as best as I can understand the science and my own body).
- Current world affairs.  When I've got time I'm not only a news junky, but I love to learn the background to why things that are going on got going, and often get involved in some small ways to try to make things better where that's possible.  There's to much to fix, but I try to do my bit.
- Teaching, coaching, leading, public speaking.  I'm not an expert in anything, but I love sharing and helping others grow in whatever ways I can.



### My Github repositories:

When I started to push code to Github, my intension was never to find work as a software developer.  Much of what I pushed up were projects I worked on while I was learning one or other skill.  Sometimes it
was to try to provide a bit of code to work with together with kids who I was tutoring.  Often, as a tour guide, I would have breaks, and then be back on the road for weeks or months, during which time
I put all my projects on hold.  But I found these things fun.  I love going back and looking at how I did things in the past.


### Hire me:

I've loved getting my foot in the door as a software developer.  In the early part of 2020, with the outbreak of Covid, I found myself with time on my hands, after what had been the most incredibly
busy few years of my life.  So I jumped into coding again.

When I arrived in the UK, I carried on with my training, and then started to look for work as lock-downs eased at the start of 2021.

What I would bring to a team:

- I have a good grasp of Python and I'm very comfortable in Linux environments.  My strongest subjects at school were always maths, and I think this mathematical mindset helps me in the code I write.
- I love things being organized.  I love writing clean, tested code, and want to get better at it.
- I love learning.  I'll gladly learn your tech-stack.  I'm happy to get feedback and learn from it.
- I love people.  I'm quiet, but I'm very much a people-person.
- I'm dedicated and very hard working.  Easy to say, of course.
- If the job fits me well, I'm keen to stay with a team and help it grow.


This is what I'd ideally like as work:

- Location: Either in Birmingham, a nearby commute or remote.
- Programming language: I've love to work with Python, but I love learning, and I'm happy to jump into anything else.
- Values: I take my own values very seriously, and I would only want to work for a company where things like diversity, inclusion... general liberal values, are important.
- "Tech for good": I want my work to matter.  Conservation has been a big priority in my life, and still is.  But I'm open to any position where what I do helps make the world a better place.
- A chance to lead down the line.  I have long worked in leadership in some way or another, and I'd love to work in a team big enough that down the line I can find myself in some form of leadership.
- Benefits and salary: I'd love to earn somewhere around 40K right now, more would be better, of course.  I'm not that concerned about other benefits, but if the team I work with are happy, I'm happy, so the main value of other benefits that I see are ones that promote a team that loves to be there.  Where people are proud of where they work and happy to be there.
